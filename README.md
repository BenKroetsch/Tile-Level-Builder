# Tile-Level-Builder
Using the mouse the user can create a 20x12 block level. 
On the right hand side the user can select a block by clicking it. 
They can also browse through the collection of blocks by pressing the "w" key. 
To place a block simply press the mouse on the white tiles and they will actively update. 
A row of white tiles separates the selection area on the right, from the level canvas on the rest of the screen.
